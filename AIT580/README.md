# COVID-19 Behaviour Change Impact Study - Cycle Three

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes the **COVID-19 Behaviour Change Impact Study - Cycle Three: B2C Quantitative Dataset (2022)** to understand shifts in consumer behavior, sectoral dynamics, and socioeconomic patterns caused by the pandemic. It uses a combination of **Python**, **R**, and **SQL** for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

##  Objectives

- **Identify Behavioral Changes:** Explore changes in routines, service usage, and purchasing patterns.
- **Analyze Sectoral Impact:** Examine how different industries (healthcare, retail, tech, etc.) were affected.
- **Measure Policy Support:** Evaluate public response to cost-related assistance and support mechanisms.
- **Understand Demographic Trends:** Investigate behavioral shifts across age, income, ethnicity, etc.

##  Dataset
- **Format:** Excel (`oomph CVII study cycle 3 - B2C Quant Data Set 2022.xlsx`)
- **Size:** 10,000+ entries, 30+ features
- **Key Features:**  
  - Demographics: age, gender, ethnicity, income  
  - Economic data: job status, income change  
  - Behavioral patterns: online shopping, healthcare access, digital tech usage  

##  Tools & Technologies

| Tool        | Purpose                            |
|-------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Python**  | Data cleaning, EDA, visualization   |
| **R**       | Descriptive statistics, summarization |
| **SQL**     | Data extraction, aggregation        |

##  Methodology

- **Preprocessing**
  - Missing value imputation (mean/mode)
  - One-hot encoding for categorical data
- **Descriptive Statistics**
  - Used R's `summary()` function
- **SQL Integration**
  - Joined demographic, behavioral, and economic tables
- **EDA**
  - Visualized behavior shifts using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## Key Results

- **Cost-related Assistance:** Found most effective in Health & Hospitality sectors
- **Behavioral Shifts:** 50% of participants reported lasting changes; none fully reverted to pre-pandemic habits
- **Ethnic Group Insights:** White respondents rated policies most positively; high "Prefer not to say" indicates sensitivity
